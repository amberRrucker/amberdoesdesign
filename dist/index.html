I’ve spent my career obsessing over how people interact with technology in order to create beautiful, efficient, testable products with the data to prove it.</p>

             I had the incredible honor of establishing the design, testing, and research programs at an established start up in the emerging field of political tech, but I am by far most proud of educating and leading younger designers. Coaching them through learning how to create prototypes, working within design systems, running user tests, performing client interviews, writing case studies and documentation,  participating in and running their own design sprints as well as mentoring them along whatever continued learning path they chose including learning front end development and eventually deploying full features. I haven’t been more proud of anything I’ve ever accomplished than watching these designers and developers grow and encouraging all the members of the company to participate more in the design process.

          <p class="rackspace-desc">
             Being at an enterprise company meant I had so many, very talented people to learn from and I spent most of my first year at Rackspace absorbing as much knowledge from as many people and teams as possible. I then applied all of those learnings with tenacity and a goal of bringing unification, efficiency and design led thinking to the organization. I established a living style guide, bringing a clarity to documentation and unity to design and development teams. I brough research, data and user testing into the client facing properties and presented my findings to SLT frequently. I focused heavily on data, measurement and conversion rates and led the design team with an emphasis on those things first.

             While working at enterprise companies and start up there isn’t as much variety in your creative work. I personally feel passionately about furthering a product through long term dedication, understanding and research but I also occasionally miss the opporunity to “stay loose” so I occasionally take side projects, freelance etc. Most of this work is information architecture, hueristic consulting etc but it’s also sometimes design.
